This project was created solely out of interest in understanding the mechanisms of artifical intelligence (AI) in board games requiring varying levels of thinking and logic. 

Currently, the goal is to make a Chess AI capable of playing at a substantial level. In order to evaluate my AI's skill level, I will be pitting it against the engines used by Chess.com.

Board Games Implemented:
- Chess (Python)
- Connect 4 (Java, Python)
- Tic Tac Toe (C++)

AIs Implemented:
- None

The rest of the AIs that are not Chess are at a low priority.

To-Do:
- Chess (C++)
- Chess AI (C++)
- Connect 4 AI (C++)
- Tic Tac Toe AI (C++)
